			I’m sure it won’t come as a surprise to learn that former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) lightweight titleholder Conor McGregor, who finished 18 of his 21 wins by way of knockout, is considered the superior striker as he gears up for his Khabib Nurmagomedov title fight. But did you also know that he was the superior grappler, as well? Sure, the power-punching Irishman lost all three of his fights by way of submission, but that doesn’t mean he won’t be able to out-wrestle and out-grapple “The Eagle” when they collide in the UFC 229 pay-per-view (PPV) main event next month in Las Vegas, Nevada. That’s according to “Notorious” teammate Artem Lobov. “It is true that Khabib doesn’t really have any striking, but it’s certainly not true that Conor’s grappling or wrestling is not on that level.” Lobov told The Mac Life (transcribed by Bloody Elbow). “He can easily out-grapple Khabib, and in the wrestling as well. I see Conor stopping him in round one.” Uh huh. He can also out-smoke Nate Diaz. I guess now is a good time to mention that Nurmagomedov is a No-Gi NAGA world champion and World Combat Sambo gold medalist who set a UFC record for takedowns (21) at UFC 160, a lopsided decision win over four-time NAIA All-American Abel Trujillo. That doesn’t mean the takedown is a foregone conclusion and every fight starts out on the feet, so it will be interesting to see if Nurmagomedov chooses to abandon his gameplan simply to prove a point, much like he did here.
			And it sounds like millions of people are willing to tune in to find out.
